# Predicting Price of Laptop
## Overview
Developed a supervised machine learning model to predict laptop prices based on key features using Python and Scikit-learn. The project involved data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, evaluation, and deployment.

## Key Insights
* Imported a real-world dataset of laptops with attributes like brand, RAM, storage, processor, GPU, screen size, resolution, operating system, and weight.
* Handled missing values, data inconsistencies, and type conversions (e.g., converting storage capacities from strings to numerical values).
* Analyzed price distribution and correlation between features.
* Visualized relationships using seaborn and matplotlib to understand feature influence on price.
* Implemented a Linear Regression model as a baseline.
* Trained and evaluated models using cross-validation and RÂ² score.
* Tried other models like Random Forest and XGBoost to improve accuracy.
* Compared performance and addressed overfitting/underfitting via hyperparameter tuning.

## Technologies Used
* Python
* Pandas
* Matplotlib, Seaborn
* Scikit-learn
* Jupyter Notebook
